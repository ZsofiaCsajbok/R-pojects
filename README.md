R automation and data visualization projects

#1 I uploaded a data visualization project of my results:
- I performed a longitudinal latent class analysis, that is, I extracted 4 classes of couples who follow similar dyadic depression trajectories within the classes
- I visualized the mean depressive symptoms across the classes, across sex and along the waves of the longitudinal study
- See the figure and the code attached

#2 I uploaded another visualization project where I replicated an Economist figure:
- The figure illustrates the association between corruption and the human development index across different regions of the world
- See the figure and the script attached

#3 I created a script to automate finding new baseball players to replace those who dropped-out of the team:
- Three players had to be replaced who did not cost more than $15000000 altogether, in average had higher OBP than 0.3638687 and in total higher AB than 1469
- The two solutions both automate the search for acceptable new players

#4 I created a multi-panel data visualization about the cubic associations between partner preferences are age across men and women:
- The figure shows the curved relationship between age and partner preferences across 15 characteristics
- The individual panels are organized and the legend shows only at the bottom of the combined figure
- See the big figure and the script attached

#5 I created a multi-panel data visualization using smoothing splines to search for non-linear associations between age and self-perceived mate value
- The first figure has two panels, it shows the age x mate value association in men and women separately
- The second figure has four panels, it shows the age x mate value associations in coupled vs single men and women separately
- See the two multi-panel figures and the script attached
